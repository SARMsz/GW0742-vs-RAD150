<h1>GW0742 vs RAD150: What I Learned Running Both</h1>

<p>These are two totally different animals. <strong>GW0742</strong> is a PPARÎ´ agonistâ€”a hardcore endurance and fat-loss enhancer. <strong>RAD150</strong> is a modified SARM made to pack on mass and strength. I ran full 8-week solo cycles of both, and hereâ€™s how they actually performed in real lifeâ€”not just on paper.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked These Compounds</h2>
<p>For both, I kept diet, training, and sleep locked in. I tracked:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fat loss (calipers and weight)</li>
  <li>Muscle size (tape and DEXA scan)</li>
  <li>Strength (main lifts: bench, squat, deadlift)</li>
  <li>Recovery and endurance</li>
  <li>Sides like suppression, fatigue, or sleep issues</li>
</ul>
<p>No stacks. Just pure solo testing. Hereâ€™s what happened.</p>

<h2>What Is GW0742?</h2>
<p><strong>GW0742</strong> is a PPAR-delta receptor agonist, similar to Cardarine (GW501516), but more selective. It doesnâ€™t build muscle directly. It shreds fat, boosts endurance, and improves metabolic health. I ran <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/gw0742/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this GW0742 from Chemyo</a>.</p>

<h3>My GW0742 Results</h3>
<p>Within 2 weeks, I felt it. I was doing cardio like it was nothingâ€”longer sessions, lower heart rate, faster recovery between sets. Body fat dropped from 14.2% to 10.8% in 8 weeks. Didnâ€™t lose any strength either.</p>
<p>It felt clean. No suppression, no weird sides. Appetite stayed stable, and energy stayed high all day.</p>

<h3>GW0742 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Burns fat like crazy</li>
  <li>Boosts cardio performance fast</li>
  <li>No suppression or hormonal issues</li>
  <li>Great for fasted training and morning workouts</li>
</ul>

<h3>GW0742 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No muscle-building effects</li>
  <li>Needs tight diet to shine</li>
  <li>Not ideal for bulking</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, endurance training, fat loss</h4>

<h2>What Is RAD150?</h2>
<p><strong>RAD150</strong> (aka TLB-150) is a time-released version of RAD140. Itâ€™s esterified for longer half-life and stable plasma levels. Think of it as RAD140 with more punch and less frequent dosing. I used <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/rad150-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this RAD150 from Chemyo</a>.</p>

<h3>My RAD150 Results</h3>
<p>This stuff feels close to mild testosterone. Strength climbed like crazy. My incline bench went up 25 lbs in 6 weeks. Vascularity was sharp, and I put on 6 solid pounds of muscle with almost no water bloat. Body looked fuller and harderâ€”especially shoulders and upper chest.</p>
<p>Side effects were mild. Some insomnia around week 6. Suppression was noticeable but manageable with a short PCT.</p>

<h3>RAD150 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Crazy strength increase</li>
  <li>Full, hard muscle gains</li>
  <li>Long half-life = stable levels</li>
  <li>No liver toxicity</li>
</ul>

<h3>RAD150 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mild testosterone suppression</li>
  <li>Some trouble sleeping late in cycle</li>
  <li>Not for beginners</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Bulking, strength, recomposition</h4>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<h3>Can I stack GW0742 and RAD150?</h3>
<p>Yes. One burns fat, the other builds muscle. Stack them if you're recompingâ€”but run a PCT after for RAD150.</p>

<h3>Is GW0742 better than Cardarine?</h3>
<p>Yes. Itâ€™s a newer, more selective PPARÎ´ agonist. Less risk, more targeted effects.</p>

<h3>Does GW0742 cause suppression?</h3>
<p>No. Itâ€™s not hormonal. Zero suppression for me.</p>

<h3>How fast does RAD150 work?</h3>
<p>Strength kicks in around week 2â€“3. Mass comes by week 4+ with a solid diet.</p>

<h3>Is RAD150 stronger than RAD140?</h3>
<p>Yes. Itâ€™s longer-lasting, hits harder, and feels more stable in the system.</p>

<h3>Do I need liver support with either?</h3>
<p>No. Neither is liver toxic, but stay hydrated and run support if stacking.</p>

<h3>Best time to take GW0742?</h3>
<p>Morning or pre-workout. Helps with endurance and fat oxidation early in the day.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Donâ€™t confuse these two. Theyâ€™re powerful but serve totally different goals. <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/gw0742/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GW0742</a> is your go-to if you want to shred up, boost cardio, and keep it clean. <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/rad150-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RAD150</a> is for guys looking to dominate the gym and add real size.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve run both, and Iâ€™d do it againâ€”just not for the same reason.</p>
